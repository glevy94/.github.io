  <h2 id="getting-tossed-in">Getting tossed in</h2>

<p>Welcome to ICS 314, my first software engineering class. ICS 314 is a UH Manoa software engineering class based on javascript. It is the start
of the second week of this semester, in which so much has already been done. I have joined multiple professional communities, began to
learn most of the basics of a new programming language, and am currently setting up a professional webpage which you have come across.</p>

<h2 id="hi-my-name-is-javascript">Hi, my name is Javascript</h2>

<p>I have started my journey in learning the basics of Javascript. In my early career as a computer scientist, most languages have appeared very
similar. The most significant differences I’ve noticed are the rules behind each language. Javascript implements things in a way to make it more
fluid and efficient. It is a weakly typed language with more relaxed rules compared to java, which comes with some drawbacks. Javascript
platforms are web based and are only accessed through the web, whereas java can be deployed on many platforms. However, in today’s world almost
everything has a connection to the web, which allows many people access to the program you have written almost instantly. For software
engineering, this allows you to quickly deploy a program and provide it to people as fast as you are able to type it up.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-fast-can-you-write-something">So how fast can you write something?</h2>

<p>Speed - a new aspect to programming I have been introduced to. In ICS 314, the connection between speed and programming has been deemed
“athletic software engineering”. The idea is to find a solution to a presented problem in a certain amount of time depending on the difficulty
of the problem. The workouts of the day (WODs) are used as a way to code quicker and more efficiently, which tends to bring me stress as I am
more of a tortoise than a hare. I prefer going through the code by perfecting it and making sure it is as efficient as possible. On the other
hand, I can see how WODs may be extremely helpful with Javascript to deploy web based platforms quickly. As stated before, Javascript is a
weakly typed language making it easier to code up quickly, which can only be utilized if a programmer is able to solve problems quickly, as
well. I may need some time to adjust to this way of learning but soon I’ll be gliding through WODs with ease.</p>
