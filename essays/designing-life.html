  <h2 id="show-me-the-way">Show me the way</h2>
<p>Growing up I was always told there was a specific way to go through life. A sort of guide to how you needed to go about your life to be the most productive successfully person. These guides tended to be very cookie cutter like. Grow up, graduate high school, graduate college, get a good job, get married, start a family, and then the end. Right? Well that’s what was portrayed to me as a young child. I think this almost created a sort of negative loop in that if I skipped a stepped or did one out of order things where going to end badly. Well this isn’t the case for me. My life has jumped all around this set pattern of doing things and it has turned out just perfect. The one thing I have noticed however, is that there may not be a certain pattern in life to do things but each of life’s events can be preformed best following certain patterns. People have developed techniques or guidelines over the years through their own errors allowing others to have an easier path way.</p>

<h2 id="tell-me-the-secrets">Tell me the secrets</h2>
<p>A great example of one of these patterns in life would be the “graduate college” step of life. Although going to college is a personal choice and should not be a pattern to life if you do go there is a certain way to go about it. This design pattern as I have learned is as follows. Attend class, participate, and spend two hours a day on each class. This pattern is almost a fool proof way to preform at a high level and graduate college. Through out life there are many examples such as this one.</p>

<h2 id="design-patterns-are-everywhere">Design patterns are everywhere</h2>
<p>The most recent design patterns I have encountered in my life are associated with computer science. There are many patterns through out this discipline. These patterns lay a framework to allow people to create fast and efficient software. Just as following the pattern to succeed in college these patterns can be slightly modified but the bases of them can be found in all forms of software and programs we use today. These patterns help software engineers to follow a set of rules knowing that when they implement these rules certain things will happen.</p>

<h2 id="caught-my-eye">Caught my eye</h2>
<p>One particular design pattern I have become very familiar with is the singleton design pattern. This design pattern is a way to implement a global variable in a non language that does not support global variables. This design pattern was implemented by <a href="https://philipmjohnson.org">Professor Johnson</a> in the <a href="https://https://bowfolios.github.io">bowfolios template</a> of which my team has built upon creating <a href="https://fitness-finder.github.io/">fitness-finder</a>. This design pattern has allowed easy access to the data within the MongoDB collection. The only thing we need to do is import the instance of the variable associated with the MongoDB collection.</p>
